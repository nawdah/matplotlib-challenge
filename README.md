As shown, the Capomulin drug reduced the size of the tumor growth, by 19%, among the mice over the 45 day timeframe the test was conducted.

Of the drugs represented on the graph above, all the drugs worked on resisting the spread of the tumor better than the placebo drug. Both Capomulin and Infubinol had the least amount of growth compared to the rest of the data.

Mice that were given the Capomulin drug had a higher percent change of survival than the rest of the mice. Those given Capomulin had an 84% chance of survival, unlike Infubinol (36%), Ketapril (44%), and the Placebo (44%).
